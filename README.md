This project is focus on Maze Solving behavior of robot In a Simulation based on ROS2. Computer Vision is the key focus with integrated important robotics algorithms of Motion Planning . The type of robot we will be using is Differential Drive Robot with a caster wheel . Course is structured with below main headings .

Custom Robot Creation
Gazebo and Rviz Integrations
Localization
Navigation
Path Planning
From our robot to last computer vision Node ,we will create every thing from scratch . Python Object Oriented programming practices will be utilized for better development.
